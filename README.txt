License: GPL

Allows you to log all edits made to posts.

Whenever a post is edited (either in quick edit or full edit mode), the original text is logged and can be viewed by administrators and moderators (exact viewing permission may be set in settings). The edited text can be compared to the original text to see just what was changed. Moderators can also revert an edited post back to an earlier version (exact reverting permission may be set from the settings).

The settings for this plugin are located under the 'Edit History Settings' added at the bottom of the settings page. This plugin offers full language support.

The 'oldrelease' branch contains the 1.6 version of the plugin.
